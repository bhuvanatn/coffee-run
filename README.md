#Coffee-Run

This Application keeps track of geo-location from the start of making an order till the delivery of coffee.

It uses the Single Table Inheritance(STI). STI is basically the idea of using a single table 
to reflect multiple models that inherit from a base model, which itself inherits from ActiveRecord::Base.
